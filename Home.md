## About this Wiki
This wiki is intended to provide Voyage teams with a reference defining what to expect from the current Voyage, how to get started, and how to deal with problems that may arise during your journey. This is a ["living document"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_document) that will improve from Voyage-to-Voyage based on your experiences and feedback. Both positive and negative. 

To make a suggestion, request, or to report a correction simply open an [issue](https://github.com/Chingu-cohorts/voyage-wiki/issues) in this repo.
