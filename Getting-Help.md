## Getting Help
What to do if you haven't heard from your team for more than three days in spite of multiple attempts to contact them? Or if you haven't been invited to join your team's GitHub repo? Or maybe you haven't been added to a team at all?

The **fastest and most reliable** way to get help is to [create a ticket](https://github.com/Chingu-cohorts/voyage-wiki/issues) on the wiki's GitHub repository.

The system uses GitHub Issues, which is also widely used by Chingu teams to keep track of project tasks.

### How to Create a Ticket
1. Go to the wiki's [Issue Log](https://github.com/Chingu-cohorts/voyage-wiki/issues). You will see the list of currently open issues.

2. Click on the "New Issue" button. It will display an entry form.

3. Give your issue a title then reply to the questions, describing your problem as precisely as possible.

4. Click on "Submit New Issue".

5. GitHub will automatically notify Chingu Facilitators, who will then deal with your issue.

6. GitHub will notify you by email when someone replies to your query. Please answer any questions they may have so that your problem can be dealt with swiftly.

### Writing a Ticket

If you are unsure how to write your ticket, you can check what other people have written in theirs by clicking on an existing issue. You can also check past issues by clicking on "Closed" on the header row.

### What NOT To Do
#### Don't DM individual Chingu Facilitators on Slack
Although this might have been the way to ask for help in the past, the growing size of Chingu means that it is unsustainable.

Chingu Facilitators are volunteers. They have jobs, families and other commitments. If you DM them, your problem might wait for longer than necessary. In any case they will probably tell you to create a ticket.

The ticket system is the recommended way because it helps us keep track of unresolved issues and it doesn't rely on a particular person being available. It is fast, efficient and reliable. Use it!

#### Don't wait for someone to notice that you have a problem
It's unlikely to happen. You are in charge. Take the initiative and create a ticket!
