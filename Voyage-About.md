## Voyage Tiers

Maximizing the Voyage experience requires that it be tailored to start at an individuals current level of experience, but end up at a higher level. The overall goal of the Voyage is to give everyone the opportunity to step up to a higher level of knowledge and experience.

To achieve this participants are divided into one of three tiers based on their knowledge and experience at the start of the Voyage.

| Tier | Starting Point         | Example Voyage Projects                             |
|:----:|:-----------------------|:----------------------------------------------------| 
|   1  | Tier-1 teams are at the html to early javascript phase of their learning journey | 1. Clone a landing page! <br> 2. Don’t clone, create a landing page for your own idea! <br> 3. Advanced Tier-1s — Clone the basic functionality of Momentum |
|   2  | Tier-2 members are around the intermediate projects area | 1. Clone Trello or build a Chrome Extension <br> 2. Build something completely new! <br> 3. Find a nonprofit and build something for them. |
|   3  | Tier-3 members are between the Advanced projects and <br> backend. For Tier-3, there is more room for flexibility <br> with choosing projects, as people here often have already <br> finished a Voyage Build-to-Learn project before and they <br> can confidently lead a team to success. | 1. Build a full-stack application, aim to create value and/or impact <br> 2. Build a bot <br> 3. Find a nonprofit and build something for them. |
