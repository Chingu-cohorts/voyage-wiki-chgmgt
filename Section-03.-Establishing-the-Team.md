## Starting Your Project

The hardest part of any project is getting started. Over several Chingu Voyages some common activities of successful teams have been identified that should help you to kick off your project. 

### Create your team charter

Your teams charter will define the values all members of your team share with regard to how they interact with one another, how work is identified and assigned, and the process your team will follow to get work done. These don't have to be lengthy, but they should define how you will conduct your work to avoid confusion later in the project. 

Some examples include:

### Identify two times a week when all team members are available
### Define your teams coding standards
### Set up a task board on Git Projects, Trello, Waffle.io, etc.
