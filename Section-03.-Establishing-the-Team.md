## Starting Your Project
The hardest part of any project is getting started. Over several Chingu Voyages some common activities of successful teams have been identified that should help you to kick off your project. 

### Create your team charter
Your teams charter will define the values all members of your team share with regard to how they interact with one another, how work is identified and assigned, and the process your team will follow to get work done. These don't have to be lengthy, but they should define how you will conduct your work to avoid confusion later in the project. 

Some examples include:

### Identify two times a week when all team members are available
Successful teams communicate with one another not just via Slack, but also in realtime in Team Standup (i.e. Scrum) meetings. These are short meetings (<30 minutes) where each team member answers these questions:

1. What have I done since the last Scrum meeting?
2. What will I do between now and the next meeting?
3. What issues or questions have I encountered that I need help with?

Identifying times for these meeting at the beginning of the project places a "stake-in-the-sand" that team members can plan their time around.

### Set up a Task Board
For a project to operate smoothly members of the team don't just need to establish operating guidelines and meeting times, they also need to understand what tasks are assigned to them and when they are needed. To do this means you'll need a task board to document your user stories and where each one currently lives within your workflow. 

Many good tools exist for this including GitHub Projects, Trello, and Waffle.io to name a few. These tools all allow tasks, as a user story, to be created in a task card format, which can then be moved through the milestone lanes that make up your teams workflow. For example, common milestones are inbox, backlog, in progress, review, completed.
