## Voyage

### What's Expected of Me?


### Where Can I Find More Information About this Voyage?

### How Do I Report Suggestions and Problems with the Template Repo?

The Chingus are a collaborative organization of individuals who share a 
common goal, but not necessarily a common path to success. As a result you
will have ideas and suggestions the Voyage planners haven't thought of.
Similarly, you will run across mistakes we haven't caught.

Making the Chingu platform stonger and more relevant to the needs of its
members is an important task and one that's one responsibility of every
Chingu. As a result please take the time to open an issue [here](https://github.com/jdmedlock/voyage-repo-template/issues) if you have an idea,
suggestion, or correction to report.
