## What is Pair Programming?

There is an oft quoted adage that "two heads are better than one". *_Pair
Programming_* is a practical implementation of this advice. It leverages the
experience and knowledge of two developers to improve the speed at which an
app is created, but also its quality. 

In this process two developers work together, either side-by-side or via
screensharing, with one writing code while the other reviews the code as it is
being written. The developer reviewing the code examines it not just for
correctness, but also to ensure that it's clear, supportable, and resilient. 

The pair keep up a running dialog and frequently switch roles.

The advantage of pair programming is the developer writing the code can focus
on the tactical attributes of the code since the developer who reviews the code
is responsible for the strategic aspects.
