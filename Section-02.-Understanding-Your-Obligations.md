## General

Chingu Voyages require the following from all participants, regardless of their role. 

1. Commit to finishing the Voyage. If you start a Voyage you should make every effort to finish it. 
2. Be open and tolerant of other ideas. Use the Voyage to expand your knowledge rather than to just build on what you already know.
3. Be open with your ideas and thoughts. Innovation doesn't take place in a vaccum.

## Team Obligations

Anyone can write a function, but developing a modern complex application requires a team. Working in a team requires a mix of hard and soft skills. Successful teams are made up of individuals who:

1. Are kind to one another and respectful of opposing ideas.
2. Understand that disagreement doesn't mean you have to be disagreeable.
3. Ask for help when they need it, provide help to those who ask for it, and don't assess blame when someone else makes a mistake.
4. Commit to attending team meetings and pair programming sessions.

## Project Managers Obligations

Project Managers have the same obligations as other team members, but as leaders they must also:

1. Motivate the team to accomplish the goal at hand rather than acting as a dictator.
2. Ensure that everyone on the team has the opportunity to voice their ideas and concerns.
3. Maintain the team backlog and task board
4. Report information and status to the Chingu organization at the specified intervals.
