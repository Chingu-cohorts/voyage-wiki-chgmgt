Tier 1 teams follow a different schedule than Tier 2 and Tier 3 teams due to the fact that they have different goals. While all tiers are focused on learning and improving their skills, Tier 1 Voyagers building foundational skills and learning how to work in a team, while Tier 2 & 3 teams are more
focused on rounding out their skills by working on complex problems.

## Schedule

This voyage is eight weeks long and is subdivided into eight sprints comprised of one four-day sprint for the team to get acquainted with one another and organize, one 7-day sprint devote to selecting and designin the project, five 9-day sprints for development work, and finally a Project Closure sprint to publish and celebrate your success.
